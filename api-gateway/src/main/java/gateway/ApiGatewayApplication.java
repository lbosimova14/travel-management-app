/**
 * LESSON NOTE: API Gateway - The Single Entry Point
 * 
 * An API Gateway is a crucial component in microservices architecture that serves as the
 * single entry point for all client requests. Think of it as a "front door" to your system.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * 1. ROUTING: Directs requests to the appropriate microservice
 * 2. LOAD BALANCING: Distributes load across multiple service instances
 * 3. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION: Centralized security
 * 4. RATE LIMITING: Prevents service overload
 * 5. REQUEST/RESPONSE TRANSFORMATION: Modify requests/responses as needed
 * 6. MONITORING & LOGGING: Centralized observability
 * 7. CIRCUIT BREAKING: Prevents cascade failures
 * 
 * Benefits of API Gateway:
 * - Simplified client communication (clients only know gateway URL)
 * - Centralized cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, etc.)
 * - Service abstraction (clients don't need to know service locations)
 * - Protocol translation (HTTP to different protocols)
 * - API versioning and backward compatibility
 * 
 * Spring Cloud Gateway Features:
 * - Built on Spring WebFlux (reactive)
 * - Integrates with Spring Cloud service discovery
 * - Supports predicates and filters
 * - Built-in circuit breaker support
 * - Rate limiting capabilities
 * 
 * Alternative Solutions:
 * - Netflix Zuul
 * - Kong
 * - AWS API Gateway
 * - Azure API Management
 * - Google Cloud API Gateway
