/**
 * LESSON NOTE: Service Discovery with Eureka Server
 * 
 * This is the heart of our microservices architecture. Eureka Server acts as a service registry
 * where all microservices register themselves so they can discover and communicate with each other.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * 1. SERVICE REGISTRY: A centralized database of services and their locations
 * 2. SERVICE DISCOVERY: The ability for services to find and communicate with each other
 * 3. HEARTBEAT: Services send periodic signals to prove they're alive
 * 4. LOAD BALANCING: Distributes requests across multiple instances of the same service
 * 
 * Why do we need Service Discovery?
 * - In microservices, services can start/stop dynamically
 * - IP addresses and ports can change
 * - Services need to scale up/down based on demand
 * - Manual configuration becomes impossible with many services
 * 
 * Eureka Architecture:
 * - Eureka Server: The registry where services register
 * - Eureka Client: The services that register with the server
 * - Dashboard: Web UI to see all registered services
 * 
 * Alternative Solutions:
 * - Consul (HashiCorp)
 * - etcd (Kubernetes)
 * - Zookeeper (Apache)
 * - AWS Cloud Map
